            Barna Research shows only 1% of Jesus-followers work in the religion sphere. Many people wrongly believe that only the religion sphere is sacred work. We believe that all spheres are inherently sacred. This means that the other 99% need to be actively engaged in Godâ€™s purposes for their work. Each sphere of society has cultural impact.
To shape culture, we must empower people where they work.
